# 1\. Vision

## Values

### Respect

Respect means to us acceptance, openness and fairness.

### Reliability

Reliability stems from our own intrinsic motivation.

## Distribution

Rescued foods are given away unconditionally. This means that no one has advantages when it comes to distributing the foods. Everyone gets as much as they want.  Nothing can be saved for later or be put aside. People arriving later can choose from what is still left. Everyone decides for themselves if and to whom they want to give away food.

## 7\. Money

*   Our basic principle is: As little as possible, as much as necessary.
*   The work of Foodsharing Luxembourg is on a voluntary basis.
*   It is not allowed to sell rescued foods or to exchange them for other goods, even if those rescued foods have been used to make new products.
*   It is not allowed to set up donation boxes next to Foodsharing Points. Otherwise Foodsharing Luxembourg may be categorised as a food-selling organisation.
*   Donations for the organisation are allowed at events, if it is clear that all rescued foods are for free. For this purpose, signs labelled “donations for Foodsharing Luxembourg” and “Food for free” can be put up.
*   There is no continuous cash box.
*   Possible transportation expenses need to be paid by each person individually.
*   Finance reports should be transparent and openly accessible on foodsharing.lu.

# 8\. Hygiene-Code

## Recommendations for the immediate handling, transport and storage of rescued foods:

*   Refrigerated goods: hold up the cold chain, meaning uninterrupted transportation in cool box with cooling elements and storage in a refrigerator
*   Transport and storage of foods in food safe containers, recognizable through the labelling: Polyethylen (PE), Polypropylen (PP), foods safe symbol (glass-and-fork-symbol)
*   Store raw and processed foods separately
*   Store foods with soil on them below other foods

## Verifying edibility:

*   Before accepting or passing on rescued foods, check their edibility (if possible, without opening of the packaging)
*   Appearance and colour: inedible in case of colour change, cloudiness, freeze-burn or mould.
*   Consistency, texture and surface: inedible in case of greasy surface, mucus formation, liquidation, hardening, disintegration, gas formation and coagulation
*   Smell and taste: inedible if rotten, acid, muffled, musty, old, rancid, fermented, fishy or unctuous smell / taste

## Forbidden is the passing on of:

*   Inedible foods (see: Controlling edibility)
*   Rescued foods after use-by date
*   Raw meat , raw fish
*   Raw milk products
*   Foods with raw eggs and pastries with a filling that is not backed through (custard, blancmange, tiramisu, home-made mayonnaise)
*   Alcohol
*   Tobacco
*   Pharmaceuticals

## The handling of rescued food is not allowed in case of:

*   Diarrhea, nausea, vomiting
*   Contagious diseases
*   Skin diseases and open wounds
*   Temperature over 38,5°C

## Legal aspects for transfer and acceptance of rescued foods:

*   Foodsavers are responsible for the foods that they pass on to others
*   Foodsharing Luxembourg is not a business for food
*   Food transfers take place between private people. Hence no traceability of foods is required. This also means that the organisation Foodsharing Luxembourg is not liable for food poisoning or similar. The receiving person cannot claim any liability for consequential damage.
*   At personal transfers, everyone receiving rescued foods should be orally informed, that the rescued foods should be checked thoroughly before consumption.

## 9\. Conflict Resolution

In the event of a conflict, mediation by a Well-Being Manager is sought. The incident is recorded, and if there are more than 3 incidents within a year, two Well-Being Managers seek a clarifying conversation in which the person/s involved may be asked to relinquish one or more of their roles.

# 10\. Review

This group agreement is reviewed each year before the Annual General Meeting (AGM) so that any suggestions for improvement can be submitted to the AGM. In order to follow through with this, an Administrator sets up a working circle.
