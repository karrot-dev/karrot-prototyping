A distinction is made between the organisational meetings, which include the General Assembly and the Circle meetings, and the information meetings. The General Assembly is described in the statutes.  Circle meetings take place at least every second month.Information meetings take place at least once a month. Our meetings are non-alcoholic.

## Roles

The followings roles rotate every meeting:

*   **Facilitator:** This person is appointed at every meeting for the following one. Their task is to set the date of the next meeting on which the most Members can attend, using e.g. framadate.org, to create an agenda with a time schedule, using e.g.framapad.org, to which every other Member can add points, and to moderate the meeting.
*   **Keeper of the memory:** This person writes a report of the meeting, including the names of the Members present and a summary of discussions and decisions made. They will circulate it to all Members within 5 days after the meeting.
*   **Keeper of the time:** This person watches the clock and informs the facilitator if there is a risk of deviating too much from the planned agenda.
*   **Keeper of the heart:** This person observes the mood of the individual Members, pays attention to individual needs and is allowed to interrupt the meeting in case of crisis or conflict. They may also initiate an energizer activity to ground, refresh or calm the group.

## Decisions

Decisions are made sociocratically at the Members’ meeting, according to the principle: “Safe enough to try, good enough for now”. Only Members are entitled to make decisions. The procedure is as follows:

1.  Ask others for advice.
2.  Draw up a proposal.
3.  Present proposal.
4.  Clarify questions of understanding, without starting a discussion.
5.  Ask others for objections. Objections are justified if they credibly show how the association or its Members would be worse off as a result of the decision. Ideally, the objection should include a suggestion for improvement.
6.  Incorporate suggestions for improvement.
7.  Repeat point 3 until there are no more objections.

# Information meetings

During the information meetings:

*   a list of attendees is made
*   the visitors are introduced to our association by explaining our projects
*   the process of becoming a Member is explained to potential Members
*   attention is drawn to our group agreement
