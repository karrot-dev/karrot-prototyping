*   Our basic principle is: As little as possible, as much as necessary.
*   The work of Foodsharing Luxembourg is on a voluntary basis.
*   It is not allowed to sell rescued foods or to exchange them for other goods, even if those rescued foods have been used to make new products.
*   It is not allowed to set up donation boxes next to Foodsharing Points. Otherwise Foodsharing Luxembourg may be categorised as a food-selling organisation.
*   Donations for the organisation are allowed at events, if it is clear that all rescued foods are for free. For this purpose, signs labelled “donations for Foodsharing Luxembourg” and “Food for free” can be put up.
*   There is no continuous cash box.
*   Possible transportation expenses need to be paid by each person individually.
*   Finance reports should be transparent and openly accessible on foodsharing.lu.
