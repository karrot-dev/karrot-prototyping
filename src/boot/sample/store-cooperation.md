# Cooperation creation with companies

## Before the first contact

1.  Whoever builds up the cooperation assumes responsibility as Cooperation Manager (see Cooperation Manager).
2.  Check if the business is already listed under “places” on karrot.world.
3.  If so, find out if someone is already taking care of the business and agree on a way to proceed with that person.
4.  If not, you may ask the business privately what happens to the food leftovers, and at best address the idea at the next Member meeting or otherwise by email to all Members.
5.  Enter the business on karrot.world with the current state of negotiations, so that a cooperation page is created where all information can be assembled.
6.  Confirm there are enough Foodsavers to guarantee the regular pick-ups according to the size of the business.
7.  Clarify where and how rescued food should be distributed.

## First contact

1.  Send an e-mail to the desired business.
2.  Introduce Foodsharing Luxembourg briefly and arrange an appointment for a meeting with the responsible persons.

## First meeting

1.  Introduce Foodsharing Luxembourg in a concise manner.
2.  Ask about the current situation: What happens to the discarded foods? Are there already cooperations with other food-saving organisations? How could Foodsharing Luxembourg support?
3.  Explain the benefits for the business;
1.  Save money and labour:
    1.  for waste disposal: save container capacity.
    2.  for sorting: transfer of the sorting of foods that are no longer for sale into edible and inedible foods.
2.  Flexibility: Pick-ups on weekends, holidays, late in the evening, early in the morning or even in case of cancellation of pick-ups by other organisations.
3.  As a rule, fixed days and fixed times are determined with the Foodsavers for collection, so that the business knows exactly when the food will be picked up.
4.  If desired, the business is mentioned publicly as a supporter = free positive advertising for the business, image maintenance, reputation among customers.
5.  Ethical handling of food: contribute to the saving of edibles and to reducing climate change.
6.  With Foodsharing Luxembourg legally on the safe side: Food collections do not mean legal risks to the business (disclaimer, legal basis and hygienic guidelines).
4.  Arrange the details of the cooperation:

*   Pick-up dates: fixed days of the week and times are ideal, but also time slots and even pick-ups upon phone call from the management are conceivable.
*   Pick-up location: Where exactly (e.g.back entry)? Can the Foodsaver sort and divide there or should this take place elsewhere? Waste disposal and separation?

5.  Leave your personal contact details.
6.  Ask for contact persons and contact details of the business.
7.  Clarify public naming of the business: Can we tell where the food comes from? Can the business be mentioned to the press?
8.  Decide next steps.

## After the first meeting

As Cooperation Manager:

1.  Update the cooperation page on karrot.world, including your name and phone number as a contact person and inform the other Foodsavers.
2.  Recruit more Foodsavers for support as needed.
3.  Arrange first pick-up appointment with the business and Foodsavers who want to pick up.

# Pick-ups

## Course of a pick-up

1.  Enter your name in a free spot via karrot.world.
2.  Show up ten minutes before the agreed pick-up time with carrying devices, such as tote bags, boxes, a bicycle or car.
3.  Meet the other registered Foodsavers outside the business and enter the premises together. Show the Foodsharing Luxembourg ID on demand. In case of delay, let others know a.s.a.p. By calling and wait outside, do not enter alone to join others inside.
4.  The food to be rescued is quickly divided among the people doing the pick-up. However things should not be counted, but everyone takes what they think they can distribute or consume.
5.  Leave the business together.
6.  Give feedback from at least one person on karrot.world. This person shall indicate the estimated total collection quantity and the course of trial pick-ups if applicable.

## Behaviour during a pick-up

*   People who are not part of our association, that might want to act as a help for carrying, have to wait outside the business.
*   Bringing children or animals with you inside the business is not permitted. They should wait outside.
*   Comments on quantity, type and use of food stuff must not be made inside the business.
*   The pick-up point must be left as clean and waste-free as possible. Waste, such as packaging or cartons, must be disposed of on site according to the requirements of the business.
*   Everything edible is taken.

## Trial pick-ups

1.  Registration with the Onboarding Working Circle, who introduces the member with as many Cooperation Managers as possible so they can pick up from suitable cooperations.
2.  Information from the accompanying Foodsaver(s) about the collection quantity, carrying utensils, course, possible particularities of the respective cooperating business and the cooperation page on karrot.world.
3.  Appointments at one or more cooperations.
4.  Execution of the pick-ups.
5.  The onboarding manager decides with the accompanying Foodsaver(s) on the admission as a Foodsaver.
